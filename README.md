# Intro

README file consists of a description of the project, ideally
.md means this is a markdown file. Allows formatting.
Below when committing (saving) the file, we see a default Create README.md which means this is the first version
When editing this file after changing, that will channge to update README.md and so on. We can edit that message as well
We are adding this extra line in the first edit. This will show when we track changes

This line is being edited locally on IDE Atom
making changes, again
